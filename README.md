# Hey there, I'm Blake Gentry! 👋

I'm a developer passionate about building user-friendly, reliable, and scalable systems. 

I'm the co-creator of **[River](https://riverqueue.com)**—a fast and reliable background job system for Go and Postgres. River is fully-featured and built to scale, and its transactional enqueueing model eliminates entire categories of distributed systems challenges. Check it out at **[riverqueue.com](https://riverqueue.com)** or dive into the code [here](https://github.com/riverqueue/river).
